      <p>In many major cities in the US, there are disparities in trees depending on a neighborhood's socioeconomic
        status. For instance, Baltimore's TreeBaltimore initiative found that some neighborhoods had as little as 10-20%
        tree canopy cover, while others had over 50%.
        Philadelphia's analysis showed that low-income areas had up to 22% less tree cover compared to wealthier
        neighborhoods. In Phoenix, Central City's tree canopy coverage is only 6.1% while the more affluent Paradise
        Valley is at triple the amount - 18.2%</p>
      <p>Cities benefit far more economically, socially, and recreationally than they do with the removal of trees. As
        more and more trees are being removed around the globe and in cities, replenishing the world's supply is more
        critical than
        ever especially with the looming threats of climate change. Trees are one of the easier and more resource rich
        methods of
        tackling climate change and global warming. Today's cities simply do not have enough trees. </p>

    <!--- Why --->
    <div id="data-why" class="div-styling">
      <h3>Why Tree Equity Matters</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span>Environmental Justice:</span> Historically, marginalized communities have often borne a
          disproportionate burden of
          environmental challenges, including lack of green spaces and tree cover. Tree equity is a step towards
          rectifying these inequities.</li>
        <li><span>Health Benefits:</span> Trees improve air quality, reduce temperatures, and provide spaces for
          physical activity
          and mental relaxation. Ensuring tree equity means that all communities can enjoy these health benefits.</li>
        <li><span>Economic Benefits:</span> Trees increase property values and attract businesses. By ensuring that all
          neighborhoods
          have sufficient tree cover, you promote economic stability and growth.</li>
        <li><span>Climate Resilience:</span> Trees play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change. They
          help absorb
          carbon dioxide, reduce energy consumption, and provide natural cooling in urban areas. Making sure every
          community has access to these benefits is vital for climate resilience.</li>
        <li><span>Community Well-Being:</span> Trees contribute to a sense of community, provide spaces for social
          interaction, and
          improve overall quality of life. When communities have equitable access to trees, they tend to be more vibrant
          and cohesive.</li>
        <li><span>Educational Opportunities:</span> Trees can serve as outdoor classrooms, providing opportunities for
          environmental
          education and experiential learning. All communities should have access to these educational resources.</li>
        <li><span>Wildlife Habitat:</span> Trees create habitats for various species, promoting biodiversity. Tree
          equity ensures
          that wildlife can thrive in urban environments, benefiting both the environment and local ecosystems.</li>
        <li><span>Psychological Benefits:</span> Studies have shown that exposure to nature and green spaces has
          positive effects on
          mental health and well-being. Tree equity is an important factor in promoting mental health in communities.
        </li>
        <li><span>Public Safety:</span> Trees help to reduce crime rates and create safer, more inviting public spaces.
          Allowing all
          communities to benefit from this effect contributes to safer neighborhoods.</li>
        <li><span>Resilience to Natural Disasters:</span> Trees can provide protection against natural disasters like
          floods, storms,
          and landslides. Ensuring that vulnerable communities have access to these natural defenses is crucial for
          their safety and resilience.</li>
