  <div id="about">
    <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica; text-align: center;">What is Tree Equity? Why Does it Matter?</h2>
    <p>Tree equity is the notion that everyone, regardless of race, socio-economic background, or location,
      should beable to experience the benefits that trees provide. Trees should be equally distributed and
      assessible in a community. Trees, in addition to providing health, recreational, and economic benefits,
      also play a large part in mitigating the effects of climate change. Tree equity in cities and urban
      environments is especially important as many low income, BIPOC, and underprivileged communitities all
      around the world suffer from the lack of sufficient
      access to trees.</p>
    <p>This website focuses on the macrocosmic notion of tree equity and its importance before diving into Phoenix,
      Arizona's microcosmic tree equity stance and condition. The aim is to educate about the power of trees, their
      importance, and how to reach tree equity. In addition, we hope to connect you to organizations workings towards
      tree equity who are in need of volunteers and donations. Together, we can give everyone the trees they deserve.
