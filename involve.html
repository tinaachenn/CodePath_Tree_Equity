        <h3>Take Action</h3>
        <p>There are several ways for you to take action today to help your city become a lush urban forest. We can
          guide
          you in writing to congress about advancing tree planting bills, in writing to the EPA to demand more
          investment in tree
          related programs, in determining how to lower your energy bills at home, and even connecting you with
          organizations that work towards tree equity and run workshops that teach the
          basics of tree plantings.</p>

        <h3>Support American Forests</h3>
        <p>We understand that not everyone has the ability nor resources to physically take action. Thus, one last way
          to
          get involved is to support the mission of American Forests and contribute to the funds needed to continue old
          projects and intiate new ones. Your donation goes a long way and makes as much of an impact and our other
          methods
          of involvement. We hope you'll help us in our mission.</p>
